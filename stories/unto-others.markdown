title: Unto others
---


Luke Floret was eight years old, and he already hated school.
It was a little country infants school, in a little country suburb of a little country town.
The little country people with little country heads would piss their little money away on the pokies to see some little flashing lights, while bemoaning the little people with skin a little darker than theirs: whether they had been there longer than them, or just arrived from other parts.
This was a little former British colony on a little island called Australia.


At a quarter past three, the electric bell rang its tremolo ding-a-ling for five or so seconds.
This was the signal that the children may be released.
The children rose from their desks more or less in silence, packing pieces of stationery into the places they were meant to go.
Backpacks packed and on backs, they filtered out of the classroom, and then out the gates.
Luke started walking home, taking what he supposed was a shortcut through the cool corridor of some strange offices, through the council carpark and finally over the bridge.
In the middle of the bridge he stood a while to feel the traffic, the rhythmic bouncing of the concrete, the flexing of the steel.
Luke kept walking and as he approached the jacarandas, their slippery purple flowers covering the pavement, he took care not to disturb the bees as they hither-and-thithered about collecting their nutriments.
He liked the bees.
Once, when he was younger, he had tried to keep a bee in a jar as a pet.
Eventually the bee suffocated, but he knew they held no resentment for this folly.


At home, Luke sat on a dining chair looking at his parents' curio.
His siblings were not home, and the house was still trapped in dusk's threat of darkness.
He could smell his mother cooking some strange, sloppy, minced meat concoction.
Luke was looking at the curio but not looking at the objects it held, nor any particular feature of the cupboard itself, but his reflection through the glass.
He had noticed while staring that he could darken his vision by will.
He supposed that it was something to do with his pupils getting smaller, but was unable to verify this, as darkening his vision made it harder to see his pupils.
He wondered, idly, what would happen if he closed his pupils completely.
Would he be able to open them again, or would he remain completely blind?
Would he see perfect darkness, or would he see dreams?

In the classroom, Ms Blair was berating the children for something or other.
There was talk of kneecaps being ripped from their sockets, and Luke wasn't quite sure whether to take it as a threat or something else.
The youngest and most sensitive boy, Galli, was about to start sobbing: Luke could feel the foreign pressure building up behind his eyes.
Luke knew - they all knew - that once of them started crying, the rest would have little choice.
Such strong emotions are hard to ignore, even if they are ill-founded and unproductive.
The girl sitting next to Galli, Truske, reached out and took hold of his hand.
This is all that was necessary; such physical forms of comfort need not be elaborate.


Ms Blair was still berating the children, while the men in the car park parked their car.
A van pulled up behind them. They got out of the car, polished shoes on country gravel, and walked to reception.

"Class 3A."

"Down the hall, last on the right."

"I need you to sign these release forms."

"I'll let the principal do that."

"It doesn't really matter. We'll re-print them with her signature."

"I still can't believe it. They're just kids."

"They recruit them young these days."


The Asio agents left the hefty weight of paper on the receptionist's desk and continued down the hall.
Thirteen of the children in class 3A had been recruited by one of the many terrorist networks.
It didn't really matter which one.
Agents Mark Howzer and Howzer Mark were trained well.
They had attended the academy together in Canberra, both passed, and now worked in the terror prevention department.
This mission seemed easy, but they did not intend to take any chances: only *they* knew what horrors the terrorist networks were truly capable of.
In the academy, they had been taught all about the devious tactics of these fiends:
People with bombs.
Bombs with wings.
Bombs with even more bombs inside them.
Bombs with cell phones that trigger other bombs.
It was incendiary insanity, and one must be prepared to deal with that sort of thing.


Mark Howzer unholstered his pistol and opened the door.
He saw Ms Blair standing at the front of the class with something in her hand.
It could be a gun - perhaps Ms Blair is the ringleader.
Knowing that every precaution must be taken, his muscle memory guided his enpistoled hand upwards, pulling the trigger, releasing some sort of metal projectile into her muscular mammaries.
Her body toppled limply to the ground and she lay there with laboured breathing.
The children panicked and ran.
Some ran for the door, some ran for the window, some just ran.
Howzer Mark was still standing, blocking the doorway, and saw his chance for a purple heart as the children ran towards him to squeeze past.
He unloaded his pistol into Truske and the bullet slid effortlessly through her abdomen, grazing another boy behind her on the leg.
The children all stopped immediately, mute, watching as Truske's important liquid leaked out onto the carpet.
Another victory for the terror prevention squad, and a victory for democracy.

The youngest and most sensitive boy, Galli, started sobbing.

Daphne Floret was late for class as she pulled on a pair of sodden jeans straight from the washer.
She pressed the chrome switch on the coffee machine, and while it was warming up threw the rest of the clothes on the line.
After coffee and a cigarette, she stuffed a few essentials into calico tote bag with a picture of a cartoon frog, and headed for the tram station.


At the tram station she fiddled with her phone.
Seeing the date, an anxious knot of dread twisted inside her stomach: it was the twelfth anniversary of her cousin Luke's disappearance.
She must telephone her aunt today, but it would have to wait until after class.
The tram arrived and she embarked.
The tram was significantly slower than the buses, but was only one journey.
She found a seat and started flicking through the list, deciding what book to read.
After much indecision, she read a few pages of Foster's Record of Time, then disembarked at University of New South Wales.


Anzac parade and the university walk were crowded with multicoloured people: arts students; law students; hawkers selling old exam papers and others buying them; business students dressed as telco and bank spruikers, trying to endebt their fellows.
She pressed her earphones in even harder and gripped her tote bag close to her.
Slithering past the *Society for Chinese Christians* and between the two representatives of the *University Ball In Hand Working Group* - for national standardisation of pool rules - she climbed up to the computer science department and into CS13013: Introduction to Quantum Communication.

"As recently as ten years ago, it was believed that the speed of information was limited to the speed of light.
This is, of course, still technically true, but we now have ways to work around this.
By harnessing quantum entanglement, information, in the form of the spin of an electron, on one side of terra can be transported to another side.
With just three qubits and a spin test-and-swap we are able to send messages instantaneously - bypassing the limits on the speed of light, since there is no actual distance to be travelled; the electrons are simultaneously next to each other while also being seven thousand kilometres away from each other.
This reduces a latency that was once theoretically a 60ms round trip, but practically 300ms, down to a fraction of a millisecond.
With more than three qubits, the latency stays the same, but the throughput is increased.
The latest QX-512 global pairing router, only available to authorised government agencies for obvious reasons, has 512kiba-qubits - roughly five hundred thousand entangled qubits and a clock cycle of four gigahertz.
This increased throughput and reduced latency has had a dramatic effect on many industries: high frequency trading, for example.


"Back in the old days, traders would fight over physical proximity to a few exchanges: NASDAQ in New York, Tōshō in Tokyo, the ASX in Sydney.
The problem was that you could only be close to one of these.
With faster-than-light communication (FTLC), the situation changed subtly: instead of fighting over proximity to a single exchange, traders fight for proximity to a FTLC hub.
Being close to any hub allows the same travel time to any of the exchanges, and since there are more hubs than exchanges, this gives everyone a much fairer playing field on the stock market.
Hopefully this level playing field not only allows the market to reach its ideal fixpoint sooner, but it should also minimise disruptions such as the dark days of the Goldman Sachs-PWC market flooding of '23.

Daphne caught the tram back, and after cooking some dahl for her and her housemate, they both went to the pub around the corner.
They drank, smoked, and tried to avoid attracting the attention of any of the men who might have felt the need to hit on them.
The flashing lights of the pokies were mesmerising; the almost random patterns, the mockingly twee synthetic music designed to make you feel as if you're winning.


When she got home and went to sleep, she was mesmerised by different flashing lights.
She saw faint outlines, naked bodies with muscles atrophied, catheters and cannulas where skin had grown and fastened them in place.
Banks of flashing lights mounted to racks, flashing lights attached to electrodes sending pulses, and yet more electrodes reading other pulses and converting them to lights with the whole thing looping over and repeating itself.
Daphne woke up with a dry mouth.
Melatonin always seemed to do that.


Daphne grabbed the washing off the line, ate her morning comestibles, performed her ablutions, and headed for the tram.
Foster's Record of Time is a particularly dry book, consisting of entries keyed by date, and entries being things that happened.
It's more or less what you would expect from the name, and a touch more tasteful than the record books by other beer companies.

Do something else. Maybe more about CS13013?
Another dream about the centre.
She needs to learn more about how it actually works, and how they are doping them up with Tropozone, which is basically just a paralysis drug.
With the bodies paralysed, they can just use their brains as pure communication devices.

Need to try a few ways to free them.
Direct route: try to find where one of them is.
It shouldn't be too hard because that's where everything connects to.
There should really be one in the Sydney CBD, you'd expect.
Tries to get in, maybe gets a job at Amazon to get access, but still can't get in.
Organise a heist with the promise of data and hardware? No - it's not worth doing that physically, the hardware would be too hard to fence, and the data is easier to get externally.
It's not possible to get in, but could you kill the power? Just pour some water in the diesel generators. What would you do once the power goes out though?

In another dream, Daphne sees the name of the drug being given to them: Tropozone.
If she could somehow replace the Tropozone with something more benign, maybe that's just the push that's required.
It's still under patent, so there's only one manufacturer: Chemtex.

Chemtex is a brand leader in Chemical Solutions for Today's Problems™.
If you had your 'flu shot this season, chances are your blood stream contains minute amounts of Chemtex patented synthetic lipid bilayers, allowing antigens to be delivered *in vivo* to immune cells.
If you have ever broken a bone and had it welded back together, chances are your skeletal system contains some amount of Chemtex bioplastics.
If you drink municipal water, chances are your bones and teeth contain at least two percent by volume, of Chemtex's fluoride.
Your house is lousy with Chemtex products, but you wouldn't know to look at them: anti-bacterial soap, scented facial tissues, bleaches and cleaning products.

Daphne can somehow "hack in" to the Chemtex laboratory, and modify the recipe for Tropozone.
Maybe change one of the ingredients from L-tyrosine to R-tyrosine. Probably not.
If she changed one of the solvents from polar to non-polar, or just modified the temperature from 80'c to 50'c.
It might even be possible to just replace the whole recipe with an antiemetic.


Some operating theatre in West Virginia, some poor fool is having his gallbladder removed.
If you were given an antiemetic instead of an anaesthetic wouldn't they notice before they started?
Oh well.


Robots, vats, sludge pouring out onto Möbius strip conveyors, moisture disappearing, blister packs hermetically sealed.
Ships, trucks, a little cart wheeled by a short stout lab coat, pushing through sensor doors with hotdog fingers.
Hotdog fingers with little prints thumbing for elevator buttons, descending still.
Blister packs unsealed, tablets poured into mortars and then pestled, powders mixed with distilled water and poured into plastic bags, plastic bags connected to intravenous drips and stored for later use.
It was time to wake up.
